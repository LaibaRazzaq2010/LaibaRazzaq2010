👋 Hi, I’m @LaibaRazzaq2010

👀 I’m interested in data science, data analysis, and uncovering insights from numbers.

🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis techniques, machine learning, and how to visualize complex data.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects or anything related to Python, R, or machine learning.

📫 How to reach me: shoot an email to laiba@example.com.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a writer too – when I’m not crunching numbers, I’m crafting stories with unexpected twists!
